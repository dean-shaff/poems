As China fortifies its economic ties with resource rich states in Africa, offering lucrative investments, particularly in the realm of infrastructure, in exchange for raw materials, Western accounts of this emerging relationship have taken on a more skeptical tone. Occidental representations of a nascent third world cosmopolitanism have largely centered on the negative prospects of this relationship and particularly on labour exploitation, dependency and more implicitly, the dystopia of a Sinocentric Africa. The discourse on contemporary Sino-African relations has been carried out in an excessively foreboding tone, extrapolating a neo-Imperialist catastrophe for Africa beyond the age of Western hegemony. However, what is most problematic about these accounts is their lack of reflexivity, in particular, the absence of investigation into the authors’ biases and interests. Selective omissions are made concerning the West’s involvement in modern Africa and the West’s colonial history in Africa as well as the civilisational anxiety which underlies the production of the said articles, facilitating the propagation of a historically de-contextualised, and yet politically charged, melodrama.
