Whitecaps on the bay:
A broken signboard banging
In the April wind.

Shoelaces untied
become a tripping hazard.
Hope she falls for me.

Laughing among friends -
palate cleansing for the soul.
A welcome relief.

red, fermented fruit 
bold, yet not presumptuous.
My life's tasting notes.

Flowers withering 
beneath the weight of the sun.
Yet the weeds stand proud.

Thankful for the rain
she dances in the puddle.
Wet shoes and cold feet.

It is easier
To accept criticism
When it's not spoken.

While the smoothest stones
try to skip in defiance
The pond claims them all.

When you're capable
of loving until it hurts,
You're doing it right.

Hopelessly in love
The bright star I named for you
Just fell from the sky.

The sweetest of leaves
Can become rather bitter
When steeped for too long.

All of these straw men
Together must constitute
A huge fire hazard.

Denying oneself -
The litmus test of true love.
Try again later.

Enter Second Act.
Things aren't as bad as they seem -
They are much, much worse..

I so dislike things
That are redundant and things
That repeat themselves.

This is a haiku
You could write a better one -
Go ahead and try.

Cicadas, frog ponds...
Riffing on haiku masters
Is okay with me.

May this day be filled
With wonder and surprises.
But only good ones.

Years may come and go
but our friends and memories...
what was I saying?

Facebook is like a
Wormhole - it brings old friends close.
And it sucks up time.

Happy Monday, friend!
May today's coffee be strong
And the day inspired.

Summers sensations
Promising pastel colors
Cozy carnations

Drinking every drop
Where the love goes it follows
Rain bows to roses

Spring has treasures told
Gently birthed from the first rain
Dandelion gold.

When summer sun seeps
Lily of the valley sleeps
Rise in the midnight

The talk of the town
Whispers of wild affairs
Tulips are silenced

Eye popping pansies
Extravagant explosions
Playfully perfect

Her stretch jeans
my Indian friend drapes me
in a sari
　
Ideal day for a walk
in the chrysanthemum garden
my favorite red canvas shoes
　
Shuttered windows glow
sound of geta striking stones
dusk in Kyoto

Poetry reading
someone outside
looking at the stars
　
Moscow supermarket . . .
American greets the cashier
with a smile
　
Over Cabernet
your red cheeks
my red lips
　
Remnant from past storms--
wine cellar at the old inn
built from the felled trees
　
Silent night
a disused warehouse
graffiti vernissage
　
Opening
facebook.com
starry night
　
First stars--
the woods of the taiga resting
in deep silence
